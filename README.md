# Stegomalware detection in GIF Files

Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection. The secret data is then extracted at its destination. The use of steganography can be combined with encryption as an extra step for hiding or protecting data. Steganography can be used to conceal almost any type of digital content; including text, image, video or audio. The cover file (The file in which the secret data is hidden) can also be any type of digital content.

Cybercriminals use steganography for a variety of tasks such as hiding malicious payloads and script files. They often use LSB steganography method to hide their malware code in images, videos or audios and execute them with another program after the file is downloaded on the victim’s computer. Such type of malware is called stegomalware. 

This project demonstrates a stegomalware detection method in GIF file (Version 89a). The implementation details and information about the GIF structure are specified in the 'References' section.

### Directories

The folder 'original\_gifs' contain normal safe gifs whereas the folder 'manipulated\_gifs' contain GIF files with extra information embedded into them. (Not malicious. Just for demonstration purposes, the hex code of the GIFs have been edited.)
